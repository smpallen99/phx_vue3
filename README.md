# PhxVue3

Project that includes a vuejs 3 project using esBuild.

## Usage

Navigate to `http://localhost:400/vue` to display the simple VueJs app.

## Notes

This is an early prototype to demonstrate:

* configuring esBuild
* copy vue asset images
* include the css files
* HMR for the Vue files
* vue-router
* dynamic import modules (see router)

### Todo

1. Get scss and sass working
1. Get store working
1. Test with production and releases
1. Add linting and formatting
1. Add component library (quasar)
1. Figure out server -> client communications (without API)
  * perhaps with channel connected to a pinia/vuex store?

## Misc

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
